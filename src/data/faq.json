            "ans": "You can schedule a free, 15-minute phone consultation. This is an opportunity for us to get to know each other and see if we might be a good fit. I will tell you a bit about myself and ask you to briefly share what you’re hoping to address in therapy. You are welcome to ask me questions as well! We may also discuss logistics, like scheduling and billing. This is your chance to gain a better sense of who I am so that you can determine if you’d like to work with me."

When scheduling an initial session, clients will receive an email from Alma requesting credit card information to keep on file for AutoPay. Please note that I have a 24 hour cancellation policy. In the event of a late cancellation or missed appointment, clients will be charged a $75 fee. I am currently accepting new clients for telehealth sessions. I utilize a version of Zoom that is secure and HIPAA-compliant for all sessions."
