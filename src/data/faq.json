            "ans": "You can schedule a free, 15-minute phone consultation. This is an opportunity for us to get to know each other and see if we might be a good fit. I will tell you a bit about myself and ask you to briefly share what you’re hoping to address in therapy. You are welcome to ask me questions as well! We may also discuss logistics, like scheduling and billing. This is your chance to gain a better sense of who I am so that you can determine if you’d like to work with me."

            "ans": "I accept UnitedHealthCare, Optum, Aetna, Cigna, Oxford Health Plans, Oscar, and many of their subsidiaries. If your insurance isn’t listed above, you can still receive superbills, or invoices of services, to submit to your insurance for partial reimbursement. I encourage you to check with your insurance company about their out-of-network coverage."

            "ans": "My private pay rate is $150 for a 55-minute individual session. You have the right to receive a “Good Faith Estimate” explaining how much your care will cost. Under the No Surprises Act, a healthcare provider must give patients who don’t have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the expected charges for medical services, including psychotherapy services. While it is not possible to know in advance how many sessions may be necessary or appropriate for a given person, this form provides an estimate of the cost of services provided. If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good Faith Estimate, you can dispute that bill. For questions or more information about your right to a Good Faith Estimate, visit https://www.cms.gov/nosurprises/consumers."

            "ans": "All clients must be enrolled in AutoPay as a means of ensuring payment for services received. When scheduling an initial session, clients will receive an email from Alma requesting credit card information to keep on file for AutoPay. Please note that I have a 24 hour cancellation policy. In the event of a late cancellation or missed appointment, clients will be charged a $75 fee."
